# CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of this app was to create an Android application that would allow a user to make an account, sign in, add items to their inventory, modify their quantities, delete items, and even enable/disable push notifications.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were a few screens necessary to capture all of the required functionality. First, I had to make a sign in screen that would also allow a user to make an account if they didn't have one. I then needed a main screen that would show the user all of their current items. Lastly, I needed a screen that would allow a user to create a new item. I tried to keep users in mind by providing consistent design across the different screens, and I do believe I accomplished this. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Whenever I am designing a program, I start by making a clear list of the requirements. I break them down into small, manageable, and testable steps. I will then go through them one by one, making sure that each of them works as expected before moving on to the next. 
    
## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my program on multiple different Android emulators running different screen sizes and Android versions. This was important, because it revealed that different devices may display things differently depending on the code powering the designs and behavior.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had the hardest time with the visual design aspects of the project. Designing user interfaces is not a strong skillset of mine yet, so I had to spend a lot more time on this than other parts of the project. 

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think did I did very well in overall code logic and documentation.
